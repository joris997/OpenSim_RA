100 timed simulations (20 sec)]
these are as in the images in this folder
Z-axis rotation = 0.0 rad
simulation as in the pictures
  Cylinder:	0.1917
  Ellipsoid:	0.3233
  Viapoints (6):	0.1497


100 timed simulations (5 sec)
different setup then above so only use this comparison separately
Z-axis rotation = 0.0 rad
  Cylinder: 0.195
  Ellipsoid: 0.223
Z-axis rotation = 0.8 rad
  Cylinder: 0.212
  Ellipsoid:  0.832
